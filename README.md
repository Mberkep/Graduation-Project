The Smart Tool Cabinet project revolutionizes tool management in industrial and workshop settings through a C# Windows Forms application integrated with advanced image processing techniques. This system enhances efficiency, security, and accessibility by using real-time image recognition to monitor tool status and condition, automatically detecting presence, absence, or misplacement. The application features a comprehensive database cataloging tool specifications, maintenance history, and current locations within the cabinet. By incorporating intuitive design principles, the interface prioritizes ease of navigation and user interaction, ensuring automated tracking and alerts for discrepancies and worn tools, ultimately streamlining tool inventory management.
